# Group theory lectures

These are group theory notes I made for MSRI-UP (Mathematical Sciences and Research Institute Undergraduate Program) in 2016, in which I was a research mentor.  The folder contains the slides for each section of the series, which were compiled together to make the algebraNotesMSRI-UP2016 file.  The unabridged version has solutions to all the exercises.
