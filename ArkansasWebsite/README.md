# Arkansas website

These are all the files (that I could salvage over the years) for the website I had when I worked at University of Arkansas.  The website was built entirely from scratch (well, I used my website from grad school as a template, and that website was made from scratch) using html, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
