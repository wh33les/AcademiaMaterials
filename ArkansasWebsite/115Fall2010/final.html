<table cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><b>date:</b></td><td>Fri 17 Dec 2010</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>time:</b></td><td>10:30a-12:30p</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>location:</b></td><td>Chem 1210 -- find this place BEFORE exam morning</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>early/extended time:</b></td><td>Arrive in the Math Lab no later than 8:45a with your student ID.  The test starts at 9a.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>allowed:</b></td><td><u>one</u> 3 x 5 '' notecard (you can put whatever you want on either side), calculator but no QWERTY keyboard</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>material:</b></td><td>Up to Sect. 6.1, cumulative.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>if ill:</b></td><td>Don't be, since it takes an act of Congress to excuse an exam no-show.  You need at the very least a doctor's note specifically saying you're too sick to take the exam in
order for the department to even consider excusing you.  But please keep me informed, regardless.  </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>exam rules:</b></td><td>We start as close to exactly 10:30a as possible.  One of the proctors will draw a map of the room.  Sit together as a section and in alternating seats.  Questions are OK but be warned: the answer will be "Do your best."  The only exception is if there's an error on the test.  But there won't be.  When you
finish, give me your test.  If you finish early you can leave, but not during the last 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>after:</b></td><td>Email me to set up a meeting time if you want your test returned.  No point-grubbing as in the two midterms.</td></tr>

<p>Excellent semester!  You all were a pleasure to teach.  Good luck on the final, and in future endeavors!</p>
