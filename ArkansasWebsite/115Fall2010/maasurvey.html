<h3>MAA Survey Instructions for Students:</h3>

<p>Students in fall term Calculus I:</p>
<p>Please go to 

<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LCTZDQG?c=1349">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LCTZDQG?c=1349</a>

and complete the survey. It should take about 15–20 minutes of your time.  This is a follow-up to the nationwide calculus survey that was given to your class at the start of this term.  Even if you did not complete the survey at the start of the term, it is important to answer this survey so that we can gather a picture of student impressions of their calculus instruction across many different types of institutions and instruction.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact Olga Dixon at the MAA: programs@maa.org or telephone at (202) 319-8498.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Earlier in the semester:</h3>
<p>Students in fall term Calculus I:</p> 
<p>Your calculus class has been selected to participate in a nationwide 
survey of Calculus I instruction, funded by the National Science 
Foundation and run by the Mathematical Association of America. The goal 
of this study is to improve college-level calculus by enhancing our 
understanding of who takes calculus and what factors contribute to a 
successful course. We need your help to do this.</p> 
<p>Please go to <a 
href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RL8CBLT?c=1349"> 
https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RL8CBLT?c=1349</a> 
and complete the survey. It should take about 10–15 minutes of your 
time.</p> 
<p>No individually-identifiable information about any student will be 
released to anyone.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your assistance in this important study. Toward the end 
of 
the term, you will be asked to go back online to comment on your 
experience of the course.</p> 
<p>If you have any questions, please contact the MAA: 
programs@maa.org.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>David Bressoud, President</p>
