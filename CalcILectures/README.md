# Calc I lectures

These are the slides I made when I taught calc I at University of Arkansas.  They were based on Power Point slides Shannon Dingman made, which were later transcribed to basic Beamer slides by Brad Lutes.  The files from each lecture are compiled into a larger slide show for each week, which are then compiled into the cal1spr16Lectures file.
