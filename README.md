# Academia materials

Showcase of materials I have produced throughout my academic career.  I have included the source code for these items, since most of them were made using LaTeX.  

For teaching materials, I have an entire local folder full of stuff I have accumulated over the years, but it seemed like it would be too overwhelming to upload everything.  If there is demand in the future, then I will post more.  <!--If there are materials from a particular year, course, or institution you would like to see (you can get more information about that from [my website](https://wh33les.github.io/Academia/academia.html)), then .-->

I have included some talks I have given for the research aspect of my academic career.  [You can find the papers I've written on arxiv.org.](https://arxiv.org/search/math?query=Wheeler%2C+Ashley&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50)   

Here is a summary of exactly what's in this repository: 

* The ArkansasWebsite folder contains the files for my website from University of Arkansas.  Since I was able to hold onto those files, most of the links still work.  Check out, in particular, the expository section!

* The GroupTheoryLectures are from MSRI-UP in 2016. 

* The cal2fa20Lectures are lectures I made when I taught calc II remotely at Mount Holyoke College.  I lost the source file.

* JMM2014 is a talk I gave at the Joint Math Meetings on my thesis project.  I couldn't find the source file.  The slides use a lot of TikZ.

* The n5t3r4 file is the output from some code I had written in Macaulay2 (M2) during grad school.  M2 is not made for Windows, so I had to use an emulator and emacs to run it.

* The StuCATalk file is notes from a talk I did in grad school.  At the time, my advisor was using PlainTeX to write all his notes so I learned how to use it, too, to make my notes look like his.

* Syllabus2023 is for the grad level commutative algebra course I taught at Georgia Tech.

* The VITfa2020 file is a talk I did on a matroid varieties project.  I've talked about this project millions of times, but these slides were particularly polished for a series of Youtube videos I did called ["Virtual Inspiring Talk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2BLDSyJqew&list=PLVDqIaLqAssM8_EftT-1l4OGmtpLFjeur&index=1&t=0s&ab_channel=AshleyK.Wheeler).  The most challenging part of making these slides was inserting the background picture.
