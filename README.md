# AcademiaMaterials

Showcase of things I have used code to make throughout my academic career.  

The ArkansasWebsite folder contains the files for my website from University of Arkansas.  Since I was able to hold onto those files, most of the links still work.

The GroupTheoryLectures are from MSRI-UP in 2016.

The n5t3r4 file is the output from some code I had written in Macaulay2 (M2) during grad school.  M2 is not made for Windows, so I had to use an emulator and emacs to run it.

The VITfa2020 file is a talk I did on a matroid varieties project.  I've talked about this project millions of times, but these slides were particularly polished for a series of Youtube videos I did called ["Virtual Inspiring Talk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2BLDSyJqew&list=PLVDqIaLqAssM8_EftT-1l4OGmtpLFjeur&index=1&t=0s&ab_channel=AshleyK.Wheeler).  The most challenging part of making these slides was inserting the background picture.
