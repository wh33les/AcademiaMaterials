# Academia materials

Showcase of things I have used code to make throughout my academic career.  

Most of the folders just contain raw teaching materials I've used over the years.  The materials were made using LaTeX and the source files are included, too. 

<!-- The ArkansasWebsite folder contains the files for my website from University of Arkansas.  Since I was able to hold onto those files, most of the links still work. 

The GroupTheoryLectures are from MSRI-UP in 2016. -->

The cal2fa20Lectures are lectures I made when I taught calc II remotely at Mount Holyoke College.  I lost the source file.

JMM2014 is a talk I gave at the Joint Math Meetings on my thesis project.  I couldn't find the source file.  The slides use a lot of TikZ.

The n5t3r4 file is the output from some code I had written in Macaulay2 (M2) during grad school.  M2 is not made for Windows, so I had to use an emulator and emacs to run it.

The StuCATalk file is notes from a talk I did in grad school.  At the time, my advisor was using PlainTeX to write all his notes so I learned how to use it, too, to make my notes look like his.

The VITfa2020 file is a talk I did on a matroid varieties project.  I've talked about this project millions of times, but these slides were particularly polished for a series of Youtube videos I did called ["Virtual Inspiring Talk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2BLDSyJqew&list=PLVDqIaLqAssM8_EftT-1l4OGmtpLFjeur&index=1&t=0s&ab_channel=AshleyK.Wheeler).  The most challenging part of making these slides was inserting the background picture.
