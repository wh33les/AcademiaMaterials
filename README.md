# Academia materials

Explore a comprehensive showcase of materials produced throughout my academic career, with source code provided for items created in LaTeX.

**Teaching Materials:** While I have accumulated an extensive collection of teaching resources, I’ve opted not to upload everything to avoid overwhelming users. More materials may be added if there’s demand.

**Research Talks and Papers:** This repository also includes talks I've given, alongside [my research papers available on arxiv.org.](https://arxiv.org/search/math?query=Wheeler%2C+Ashley&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50)
